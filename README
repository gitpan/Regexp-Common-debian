==== OVERVIEW ====

  The Regexp::Common::debian is collection of REs for various strings
  found in the Debian Porject <http://debian.org>.  It's no way intended
  to be a validation tool.

  Right now (before first release) I can't decide what version of Perl
  is needed.  I should admit though, I'll do my best to support perl
  distributed with ``stable'' release of Debian GNU/Linux (at time of
  writing it is ``v5.8.8'').  And I'll try hard to support perl in
  ``oldstable'' (``v5.8.4'').


==== INSTALL ====

  The R::C::d is distributed with Module::Build.

      $ perl Build.PL
      $ perl Build
      $ perl Build test
      $ perl Build install

  Since we're about strings we need a lots of strings to test against
  (Test::More, unspecified version).  To access them easily (it's all
  about reuse, not implemented yet) I need an apropriate storage. 
  Accidentally it's YAML::Tiny (unspecified version).

  If any test string fails I need to know what and how.  To provide that
  info I've picked Test::Differences (maybe there's other option I'm not
  aware of?).  (Surely I could go one of fail-proof ways described in
  T::D pod; and what if something goes wrong? let's no play stupid hope
  -- I must know what happened.) That yeilds a big problem.  T::D has
  two (actually one) open bugs --
  <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=38320> and
  <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41241> -- at time of
  writing they are still open, no maintainer responce, patch is
  provided.  Some test strings of R::C::d give ``undef'' as predicted
  result.  That will provide a lots of "use of undef" warnings (really,
  a lots of).  And as a matter of fact, T::D will be somewhat useles --
  forgive me, let me figure out version relations first.
