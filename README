==== OVERVIEW ====

  The Regexp::Common::debian is collection of REs for various strings
  found in the Debian Porject <http://debian.org>.  It's no way intended
  to be a validation tool.

  Since Regexp::Common::debian uses our operator that was introduced in
  ``v5.6.0'', R::C::d needs ``v5.6.0'' to run.  I should admit though,
  I'll do my best to support perl distributed with ``stable'' release of
  Debian GNU/Linux (at time of writing it is ``v5.10.0'').  And I'll try
  hard to support perl in ``oldstable'' (``v5.8.8'').


==== INSTALL ====

  The R::C::d is distributed with Module::Build.

      $ perl Build.PL
      $ perl Build
      $ perl Build test
      $ perl Build install

  Since we're about strings we need a lots of strings to test against
  (Test::More, unspecified version).  To access them easily (it's all
  about reuse, not implemented yet) I need an apropriate storage. 
  Accidentally it's YAML::Tiny (unspecified version).

  If any test string fails I need to know what and how.  To provide that
  info I've picked Test::Differences (maybe there's other option I'm not
  aware of?) (I'm, Test::Deep).  (Surely I could go one of fail-proof
  ways described in T::D pod; and what if something goes wrong? let's no
  play stupid hope -- I must know what happened.) (After looking at
  number of ``UNKNOWN'' results from CPAN-Testers -- I think, I should.)
  That yeilds a big problem.  T::D has two (actually one) open bugs --
  [38320@rt.cpan.org] and [41241@rt.cpan.org] -- at time of writing they
  are still open, no maintainer responce, patch is provided.  Some test
  strings of R::C::d give ``undef'' as predicted result.  That will
  provide a lots of "use of undef" warnings (really, a lots of).  And as
  a matter of fact, T::D will be somewhat useles -- forgive me, let me
  figure out version relations first.
